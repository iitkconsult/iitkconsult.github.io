                                Makerere University to predict deforestation's evolution in a spatial zone. To 
                                achieve this, we used machine learning techniques such as time series forecasting 
                                and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on satellite images and ground reports collected 
                                by Makerere University. We aimed to provide the stakeholders with better insights
                                 to make informed policy choices regarding climate change. By leveraging our
                                  expertise in machine learning and data analysis, we made a positive impact in 
                                  addressing deforestation and promoting sustainable land use.</p><br><br><br><br>

Using time series forecasting and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) techniques, our model incorporated various data sources, including weather and traffic. This model is expected to aid in devising policy interventions to protect citizens' health from the harmful effects of poor air quality.</p><br><br><br><br>

                                other geographies in South-East Asia. The aim was to identify incidents of

                                lack of available ICU units. This system can help understand the medical

After doing a SWOT analysis, we also recommended four learning management systems. To support and oversee more than 27,000 students as part of Navjyoti's upskilling project, one of these platforms was chosen.</p><br><br><br><br>

We analyzed leading sustainable institutes to strategize methods for reducing water consumption, wastage, and extraction at IITK. After securing initial funding of over 25 lakh Rupees from SECI (a PSU), we have floated tenders for deploying a water sensor network across key campus areas. This network will enable the creation of a real-time water dashboard and implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems to conserve water effectively.</p><br><br><br><br>

This involved ideating 21 use cases, mapping them on a 2x2 matrix, and creating an Excel dashboard for scoring based on nine parameters. Each use case underwent comprehensive analysis across six sections, including problem overview, description, geospatial data utilization, beneficiaries involved, proof of concept, and impact.

By bridging the gap between demand and supply, our goal is to make India self-reliant in medical technology. We conducted research based on AIIMS portal tenders extracted through web scraping and parsing. Additionally, we performed a SWOT analysis of the med-tech industry and examined government reports on disease distribution to identify prevalent diseases in India. Using this data, we analyzed patient's journeys for each disease to identify bottlenecks that need to be addressed.</p><br><br><br><br>

                                <p class="mb-4">In this project, we are utilizing machine learning to anticipate student dropout rates by identifying influential factors. Through rigorous analysis, we've developed a robust model with a 95% accuracy rate in predicting dropouts. Leveraging insights from this model, we aim to address the underlying causes of dropout rates. The model was validated with data from a school based in Mozambique, our approach demonstrates promising potential for scalability and applicability in diverse educational contexts. We're now in talks with NGOs to bring this solution to Indian educational settings. Additionally, we have collaborated with a NGO called Pratham for their ASER survey data to enhance our understanding and analysis.</p><br><br><br><br>
